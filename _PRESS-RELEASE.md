There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > Cocktails

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Find delectable cocktail recipes that use the ingredients you already have.

## Summary ##
  > Cocktail Menu lets you search for delicious recipes that use the ingredients you already have on hand. Pull up options, browse the recipes, and get to pouring.

## Problem ##
  > Cocktails are flavorful, creative, and full of personality. But like complex meals, they often require dozens of ingredients, many of which are perishable. If you don't have a fully stocked bar and fridge, you may have to make an expensive run to the store or find yourself making the same simple recipe over and over again.

## Solution ##
  > Cocktail Menu dynamically generates lists of recipes you can make using the ingredients you have. Given a base liquor, liquer, or even a garnish you want to build around, it will conjure up available recipes so you can spend more time pouring and less time searching.

## Quote from You ##
  > I used to use recipe books and other apps to search for cocktail recipes, but it's like looking through an elaborate cookbook: there was always at least one ingredient I didn't have on hand. I wanted Cocktail Menu to make the recipes respond to the ingredients, without taking away the creativity and choice of making and drinking cocktails.

## How to Get Started ##
  > Just enter an ingredient on the homepage! Cocktail Menu will automatically search for recipes using that ingredient. Click on recipes you'd like to explore more, and save recipes you loved so much you want to make again.

## Customer Quote ##
  > I love to make drinks for my friends, and I don't want to serve them the same thing all the time, but I also don't have the most extensive bar you've ever seen. Cocktail Menu has made it really easy to find a variety of cocktails I can whip up without having to make an expensive liquor store run.

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Ready for a delicious drink? Try it out!
